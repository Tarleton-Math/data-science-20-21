    "We spent considerable time learning and writing code to produce interactive visualizations to see the performance of classifiers and regressors (at least when the number of features is small enough).  This also allowed us to explore the Holoview and Xarray python packages.  We also learned how to write our own classes so we can take advantage of python's object-oriented capabilities."

    "A [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html) is an ensemble of Decision Trees.  We've seen very clearly that decision trees are very likely to badly overfit (high variance).  One way we can cna fight this is by using a bunch of them in tandem.  Loosely speaking, each tree will overfit in a different way and these \"errors\" tend to offset when we use a bunch of them.  Again, this is the Wisdom of the Crowd in action."
